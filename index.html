        <h2>The First Spark</h2>
        <p>It was just curiosity at first. There was this girl—beautiful, bright, cheerful, and kind. I’d never been so nervous asking for someone’s name. I didn’t ask her directly, but when I learned it, it stuck with me. Unlike other times when names slipped through my mind, this time was different. I knew I needed to know more about her.</p>

        <h2>Brightening My Days</h2>
        <p>Every meeting felt special, even if it was just a light greeting in the morning or outside our rooms, which were right across from each other. Her bright, cheerful self seemed to light up my dark and gloomy days, making every moment feel like a gift.</p>

        <h2>Time Together</h2>
        <p>One day, she asked me to help her study for a test. I was delighted and taught her to the best of my ability. We spent time together, studying amidst our busy schedules. Deep down, I worried—if she passed, she might leave, and we might not meet again. When she told me she didn’t pass, I felt a secret relief (sorry 😔). I told her she’d stay, and to my joy, she seemed happy about it too.</p>

        <h2>Moments That Mattered</h2>
        <p>Our interactions grew—light greetings, short chats in the dining hall, and her occasional invitations to play volleyball. I only joined because she asked, and the best part was walking back together afterward. Sometimes I’d walk slowly so she could catch up, or I’d hurry to meet her pace. Those small talks to the dining hall were simple but unforgettable.</p>

        <h2>Love Confessed</h2>
        <p>Our bond deepened as we went out for meals or ice cream, often in a group. One day, it hit me—she was the one. My heart raced, my mind was consumed with thoughts of her. I wanted to tell her, but fear held me back. When I finally confessed, I chickened out, saying she didn’t have to take it seriously. The next day was awkward, just smiles between us. But then she reached out, saying we should talk. She told me she loved me too. My heart nearly burst. We became a couple, partners, companions—connected more deeply than ever.</p>
