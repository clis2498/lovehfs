        <h2>The First Spark</h2>
        <p>It was just curiosity at first. There was this girlâ€”beautiful, bright, cheerful, and kind. Iâ€™d never been so nervous asking for someoneâ€™s name. I didnâ€™t ask her directly, but when I learned it, I remember it well. Unlike other times when names just slipped through my mind, this time was different. I knew I needed to know more about her.</p>

        <h2>Brightening My Days</h2>
        <p>Every meeting felt special, even if it was just a light greeting in the morning or outside our classrooms, which were right across from each other. Her bright, cheerful self seemed to light up my dark and gloomy days, making every moment feel like a gift.</p>

        <h2>Time Together</h2>
        <p>One day, she asked me to help her study for a test. I was delighted and taught her to the best of my ability. We spent time together, studying amidst our busy schedules. Deep down, I worriedâ€”if she passed, she might leave, and we might not meet again. When she told me she didnâ€™t pass, I felt a secret relief (sorry ðŸ˜”). I told her lightly that sheâ€™ll have to continue being here, and to my joy, she seemed happy about it too.</p>

        <h2>Moments That Mattered</h2>
        <p>Our interactions grewâ€”light greetings when we passed by each other, short chats in the dining hall, and her occasional invitations to play volleyball. I admit that I joined the game because she asked, the game was lively and humorous tho. But, the best part was walking back to the dining hall together afterward. It wasn't planned, sometimes Iâ€™d walk slowly so she could catch up, or Iâ€™d hurry to meet her pace. Those small talks to the dining hall were simple but unforgettable.</p>

        <h2>Love Confessed</h2>
        <p>Our bond deepened as we went out for meals or ice cream, often in a group. One day, it hit meâ€”she was the one. It struck me hard that I want her in my life, I want her to be by my side, I want to be together, I want to love each other. My heart raced so fast, my mind was consumed with thoughts of her. I wanted to tell her, but fear held me back. When one day I can't hold it in anymore, I finally confessed. Unfortunately, I chickened out saying she didnâ€™t have to take it seriously. She was surprised, she said she doesn't know how to face me tommorow, well, I was much more nervous. The next day was awkward, I didn't know what to say to her, we ended up just smile to each other. But a couple of days later she reached out, saying we probably should talk, to which I said yes. That day she conveyed how she feels about me, she told me she loved me too. My heart nearly burst. I love her soooo muuuuuccchhh, I can't describe how deep I've fallen for her. We became a couple, partners, companionsâ€”connected more deeply than ever.</p>
